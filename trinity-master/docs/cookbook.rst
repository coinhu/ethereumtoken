Cookbook
========

The Cookbook is a collection of simple recipes that demonstrate good practices to accomplish
common tasks. The examples are usually short answers to simple "How do I..." questions that go
beyond simple API descriptions but also don't need a full guide to become clear.


.. _cookbook_recipe_running_as_a_light_client:

Running as a light client
-------------------------

.. warning::

    It may take a **very** long time for Trinity to find an LES node with open
    slots.  This is not a bug with trinity, but rather a shortage of nodes
    serving LES. Everyone should consider running their own LES server to improve
    the health of the network.

Use the ``--sync-mode=light`` flag to instruct Trinity to run as a light node.


.. _cookbook_recipe_ropsten_vs_mainnet:

Ropsten vs Mainnet
------------------

Trinity supports running against either the Ethereum Mainnet or
Ropsten testnet out of the box.  Use ``--ropsten`` to run against Ropsten.


.. code:: sh

  trinity --ropsten


.. _cookbook_recipe_running_a_custom_network:


Running a custom network
------------------------

Trinity can run custom networks via configuration file per
`EIP-1085 <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1085>`_.

.. code:: sh

  trinity --genesis <PATH-TO-EIP-1085-CONFIG> --data-dir <PATH-TO-DATA-DIR> --network-id <NETWORK-ID>

For a more detailed writeup, checkout the guide about :doc:`Creating a custom testnet</guides/creating_a_custom_testnet>`


.. _cookbook_recipe_connecting_to_preferred_nodes:


Connecting to preferred nodes
-----------------------------

We can use the ``--preferred-node`` command line flag to instruct Trinity to prioritize connecting
to specific nodes. This flag takes an enode URI as a single argument but can be used multiple times
to prioritize connecting to a set of specific nodes.

.. code:: sh

  trinity --preferred-node enode://a41defa74e8d9d4152699cb9a0d195377da95833769ad6b386092ac3b16c184eb4ef4b4f02889e0b5097ff50fb5847ba99694d40b61f911cdea07b444b00e676@127.0.0.1:30304


Using ``--preferred-node`` is a good way to ensure Trinity running in
``sync-mode=light`` mode connects to known peers who serve LES.


.. _cookbook_recipe_retrieving_chain_information_via_web3:


Retrieving Chain information via web3
-------------------------------------

While just running ``trinity`` already causes the node to start syncing, it doesn't let us interact
with the chain directly (apart from the JSON-RPC API).

However, we can attach an interactive shell to a running Trinity instance with the
``attach`` subcommand. The interactive ``ipython`` shell binds a
`web3 <http://web3py.readthedocs.io>`_ instance to the ``w3`` variable.

.. code:: sh

  trinity attach

Now that Trinity runs in an interactive shell mode, let's try to get some information about the
latest block by calling ``w3.eth.getBlock('latest')``.

.. code:: sh

  In [1]: w3.eth.getBlock(0)
  Out[1]:

Performance profiling
---------------------

Trinity has builtin support for performance profiling via the ``--profile`` flag. When we run Trinity
with the ``--profile`` flag it creates a ``cProfile`` of every single process in the current directory.

The files are named ``profile_*`` (e.g. ``profile_discovery``) and can be viewed with any tool that
supports ``cProfile`` files.

A simple way is through ``cprofilev``

.. code:: sh

  pip install cprofilev

Once installed we can generate a HTML based report and view it in a browser.

.. code:: sh

  cprofilev -f profile_discovery
